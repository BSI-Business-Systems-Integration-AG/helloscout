# helloscout

This repository contains 2 Scout applications doing the same thing: demonstrating a simple, client only Scout Hello World application. The only difference is that one is written with Java (Scout Classic) and one with JavaScript (Scout JS).

In order to launch them, just clone the repository, import the projects into Eclipse and run the launch files:

* **Hello Java App**: org.eclipse.scout.hellojava.ui.html.app.dev/[org.eclipse.scout.hellojava] dev ui.launch 
* **Hello JS App**: org.eclipse.scout.hellojs.ui.html.app.dev/[org.eclipse.scout.hellojs] dev ui.launch

The applications will be available under http://localhost:8082/ resp. http://localhost:8084/.

**Have fun!**
